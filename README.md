#### Summary

Vacation Swap aims to cut out the cumbersome steps and research in planning a vacation. With user submitted itineraries called ‘walkthroughs’ and an in-depth rating and reviewing system, exploring the world has never been easier.


#### Motivation

Vacations are fun and meant to be relaxing, why should the process of planning one be any different? Currently, vacation-goers needs to scavenge multiple different websites and resources in order to collect and organize small bits of information. This can be confusing, time-consuming, and simply tiresome.

With Vacation Swap, users can search, plan, organize, and finalize all of their vacation needs in a single website. Vacation Swap will be designed for simple use. There will be few requirements for users to use Vacation Swap as it will be simple and straightforward to use.


#### Significance

Travel is like everything else, it falls into time-quality-cost triangle and the biggest pet peeves with “budget” travel bloggers is being cheap and not frugal. The goal of travelling is to experience things one can’t do at home. With the internet and all the new technology, you can plan your trip exactly the way you want, but when people share their itinerary it’s almost always just room & board that they are calculating. Travelling on a shoestring can be stressful and unexpected expenses hurt a lot when you are cutting thin. Vacation swap will tackle all of these and remove the external stress.  All you would need to do is pick each itinerary item and let the program figure out your expenses and budget.


#### Related Work/Background

Currently, search engines hold more than enough information about any destination that comes to mind but it isn’t offered to users in a customized format. Instead of lettings users go around and collect information, Vacation Swap will have all the information they want and presented as the customer want.


#### Proposed Work and Methods

One of the biggest hurdles in creating this website will be the collection and formatting of proper data to provide convenient and easy access to the information that the user wants. That problem also creates a few more smaller problems like how we can display all the information in an organized manner.
So far we have a clear idea of what we want Vacation Swap to do for the customer, and how we can achieve that goal. We will plan design and data handling in the coming weeks.
